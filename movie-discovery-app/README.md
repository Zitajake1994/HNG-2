A movie discovery web application

## What you need to know about this project

It allows users to search for movies, view details about those movies and react to their favorite ones. 

### instructions on the application

the movie details were fetched from the TMDB database...20 movie details were given in response from the database but an array method (slice) was used to get just the first ten movies which were displayed on the home-page. the react-router-dom, useParams were used in navigating each movie card to the movie details page where you can see informations about each movies. also, it takes 2 seconds for the api to be fetched and it was intentional by using setTimeOut function to delay it. you might not be a fan of that but it makes sense at it gives you the feeling that communication was being made to an external server.

just in case you discovered any bug or anything to be improved upon, the floor is yours.
